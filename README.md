## Tools and Technologies
To build the front end of ew:Pon, we used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, and the Parallax jQuery plugin. In the back end, we used JavaScript to query the Sqoot API, along with Chicago Public Records. In addition, we utilized Firebase Authentication to make the app more personalized.

## Limitations
Our team faced one particular challenge, _API limitations_. 
1. Restaurants found in Sqoot often did not have corresponding records in the Chicago Public Databases.
2. Some restaurants found in Sqoot did not have the same name in Chicago Public Databases, which made it difficult to pass along a query the Chicago Public DB.

## Looking Forward
In future iterations will feature:
* Fix the "splats" denoting a restauraunt's uncleanliness currently display incorrectly.
* Bookmarking feature for saving deals to the user's data.
* Parse the jargon of health inspection ratings for easier reading experience
* Expanding to include available health inspection data from other cities, beyond Chicago.
